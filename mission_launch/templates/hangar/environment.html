  <h1>🌦️ Environment Variables</h1>
  <p>Understand how humidity, altitude, and wind affect rocket performance. Planning for conditions ensures safer flights and better altitude predictions.</p>

  <h2>Key Environmental Factors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moist air is less dense, potentially improving altitude slightly but increasing motor ignition delays.</li>
    <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Higher launch sites have lower air pressure, reducing drag and boosting altitude potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Strong winds can carry rockets off-course and require larger recovery areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Affects air density and engine performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>
    Launching at high altitudes can add significant meters to your rocket’s flight—but may also require tweaks to chute sizing due to lower air resistance.
